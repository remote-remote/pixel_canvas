# Next Steps - Real-Time Canvas Implementation

## Current Status ðŸŽ‰

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Real-time collaborative drawing is working!
- Binary protocol (8-byte pixel updates) implemented
- Frame parsing and WebSocket handling complete
- Broadcasting system functional across multiple browser tabs
- Performance is "crispy" - no detectable lag

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Connection Cleanup
**Problem**: Disconnected clients aren't being removed from broadcaster registry

**Solution Options**:
- **Process monitoring** (BEST): Use `Process.monitor/1` in broadcaster to watch connection PIDs
- **Periodic cleanup**: Sweep registry and `Process.alive?/1` check (less efficient)  
- **Manual cleanup**: Connections send disconnect messages (unreliable)

**Recommended Approach**:
```elixir
# In broadcaster when connection registers
ref = Process.monitor(connection_pid)
# Store {pid, monitor_ref} pairs
# Handle {:DOWN, ref, :process, pid, reason} to cleanup
```

### 2. Canvas State Persistence
**Current**: No server-side canvas state - new connections see blank canvas

**Needed**: 
- Server-side canvas storage (ETS table? GenServer state?)
- Send current canvas state to new connections
- Persist updates as they arrive

### 3. Error Handling & Edge Cases
**Missing pieces**:
- Invalid coordinates (x/y > 1024)
- Malformed binary messages 
- Connection crashes during broadcast
- Network partitions / reconnection

## Architecture Decisions to Make

### Canvas Storage Strategy
- **ETS table**: Fast, concurrent reads/writes
- **GenServer**: Serialized access, easier reasoning
- **Hybrid**: ETS for reads, GenServer for coordination

### Broadcast Optimization (Future)
- **Current**: Global broadcast to all connections
- **Next**: Viewport-based broadcasting for spatial efficiency
- **Considerations**: Dynamic viewport tracking, area indexing

### Protocol Extensions (Future)
- **Message type 1**: Multi-pixel updates (brush strokes)
- **Message type 2**: Rectangular regions
- **Message type 3**: Cursor positions
- **Message type 4**: User metadata/presence

## Learning Focus Areas

### Process Architecture
- How to structure supervision trees for fault tolerance
- When to use ETS vs GenServer for shared state
- Process monitoring patterns for cleanup

### Performance Optimization  
- Binary protocol efficiency gains
- Spatial indexing for selective broadcasting
- Memory usage patterns with 1M+ pixel canvas

### Fault Tolerance
- What happens when broadcaster crashes?
- Connection recovery scenarios
- Data consistency guarantees

## Success Metrics

**Working System**: âœ… ACHIEVED!
- Multi-client real-time drawing
- Sub-millisecond latency
- Binary protocol efficiency

**Next Milestone**: Robust production system
- Connection cleanup working
- New clients see existing canvas state
- System handles crashes gracefully

## Technical Debt

1. **"Janky" broadcaster** - probably missing edge case handling
2. **No canvas persistence** - memory-only state
3. **No error handling** - assuming perfect binary messages
4. **No connection limits** - could exhaust system resources

## Implementation Priority

1. **Fix connection cleanup** (immediate - system stability)
2. **Add canvas state** (immediate - user experience) 
3. **Error handling** (next - production readiness)
4. **Spatial optimization** (later - performance scaling)

Remember: The core real-time engine is working beautifully. These are all refinements on a solid foundation!
